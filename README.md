# Simple-C-Login-Form

## WHAT THE PROJECT DOES

The project allows users to register an acccount or login. User's are prompted with two choices, Register and Login in. The user has to choose the appropriate key (1 or 2), to perform the action they want to perform. If a user wants to register an account, they must enter a valid username and password. The username and password are stored into a new file. If a user wants to log into an already registered account, the function, LoggingIn() is called and will have to read from the respective file for the current user. The program needs to obtain the correct username to obtain the correct password, otherwise the program is not able to open the correct file which contains the password for the username. 

## WHAT TECHNOLOGY WAS USED

The project uses the C++ programming language. I used the application VS Community for this specific project. I also used my knowledge on opening and closing files, retrieving user input, and storing input into strings. 

## WHAT I LEARNED

I learned that creating a login application doesn't have to be overly complicated. Especially for beginner programmers. I also learned that you can always improve onto simple applications like this one. If I included things like input validation or encryption for passwords, it could make my program even better and help me become a better developer in the long run.
